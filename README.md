## About this Repository
This is my Homework 1 assignment for N317! I've created a simple page using React/NextJS that displays Samsung devices in a card format. Each card includes a button to view device details, though this feature is not functional. To streamline development and avoid redundant code, I created the card component to show the device's information. I don't plan on updating this anytime soon, as this was made for my homework assignment. Feel free to branch this and expand upon it if you'd like! 😁

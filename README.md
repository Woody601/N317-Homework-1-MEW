## About this Repository
This is my Homework 1 assignment for N317! This is a simple page made in React/NextJS, that lists out Samsung Devices on the page, in a card style, with a button to view the details of the devices (which doesn't currently do anything at the moment.) The cards for the device's information were made into a component, so I wouldn't have to write out the same code more than once, for simplicity's sake. I don't plan on updating this anytime soon, as this is a very basic webpage that I had to do for my homework assignment. Feel free to branch this out, and expand upon it, if you feel more inclined to do so! üòÅ
